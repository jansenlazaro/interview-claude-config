# Project Guidelines

## Philosophy
Keep it simple. Iterate fast. Get it working.

## Development Approach
- Prioritize simplicity over elegance
- Avoid over-engineering - no unnecessary abstractions or utilities
- Build the minimal solution that works
- Skip tests - focus on functionality
- No extra configuration steps - keep build/run straightforward

## What NOT to do
- Do not write tests or test files
- Do not add extra validation or error handling beyond what's needed
- Do not create helper functions for one-time operations
- Do not add comments unless the code is genuinely confusing
- Do not refactor or "improve" existing code unless asked

## Build & Run
- Keep dependencies minimal
- Prefer inline solutions over adding packages
- If something works, move on
