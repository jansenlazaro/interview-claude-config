### CLAUDE.md Guidelines

Configures Claude Code for interview-style development:
- **Tech Stack**: Python + SQLite for zero-setup prototyping
- **No Tests**: Skip test files, focus on working code
- **Simple Solutions**: Avoid over-engineering and unnecessary abstractions
- **Data Handling**: Sample first, optimize later
- **Communication**: Explain approach before coding, show progress incrementally
